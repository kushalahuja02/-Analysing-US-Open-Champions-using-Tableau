# Tennis Dataset Analysis - US Open Champions (1881-2021)

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding high-dimensional data types and formats through the lens of tennis championship data. It mimics an analystâ€™s role in real life, requiring students to analyze and visualize high-dimensional data using various interaction and illustration tools.

### Objectives

- To deepen students' understanding of high-dimensional data types and formats.
- To employ various visualization techniques to effectively represent high-dimensional data.
- To simulate real-world data analyst tasks through detailed data analysis and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset encompasses the US Open championship matches spanning 141 years (1881-2021), including both men's and women's matches. It consists of diverse data types and forms, including:

- Year of the tournament
- Gender of the players
- Champion's name and nationality
- Champion seed
- Match time
- Runner-up's name and nationality
- Match scores


## Methodology

- **Data Preparation**: Processing the raw data to a usable format for analysis.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Utilizing tools like Tableau and Excel to create visual representations of the data.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Converting data into various formats to facilitate comparison between different data points.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Data Files**: Locate the Excel data files in the 'data' directory.
- **Analysis and Reports**: Detailed reports and analysis can be found in the 'docs' or 'reports' directory.
- **Visualizations**: Explore the visualizations in the 'visuals' directory, created using Tableau and Excel.

# Usage
***Using the Tableau Workbook***

This project includes a pre-designed Tableau workbook that allows for in-depth analysis and visualization of property market data. Here's how to use it:

Download the Workbook: After cloning this repository, navigate to the 'tableau' directory. Here, you'll find the Tableau workbook file (with a .twbx extension).

Open Tableau: Launch Tableau or Tableau Public on your computer. If you don't have Tableau installed, you can download it from the official Tableau website or use Tableau Public.

Load the Workbook: In Tableau, select 'Open' and navigate to the downloaded Tableau workbook file. Open the file to load the workbook.

***Interacting with Visualizations***

Explore the Visualizations: The workbook contains various pre-built visualizations and dashboards. Explore these by clicking on different tabs within the workbook.

Filter and Drill-down: Use the interactive features such as filters and drill-down options to explore different aspects of the data. These tools allow for a customized view and deeper analysis.
